# NavMeshPlanner Integration

## Overview

The NavMeshPlanner has been successfully integrated into your existing single-page simulation system. This provides 3D-aware pathfinding that automatically routes around walls and through doors, giving smooth, natural-looking motion through your procedurally generated house.

## What's Been Added

### 1. NavMeshPlanner Class (`lib/js/NavMeshPlanner.js`)

A complete navigation mesh system that:
- Builds a navigation graph from your house geometry
- Uses A* pathfinding for optimal routes
- Handles doors and room connections automatically
- Provides smooth 3D pathfinding with waypoints

### 2. Integration with Existing Systems

#### House Integration
- Added `buildNavigationMesh()` method to House class
- Navigation mesh is built automatically after house generation
- House stores NavMeshPlanner instance for access by people

#### Person Integration
- People now use NavMesh pathfinding for movement
- Fallback to direct movement if NavMesh unavailable
- Smooth waypoint-based movement system
- Automatic path calculation when starting actions or wandering

#### PersonManager Integration
- People get house reference for NavMesh access
- All new people automatically have NavMesh pathfinding

## How It Works

### 1. House Generation
```javascript
// After house is generated
const navMeshSuccess = house.buildNavigationMesh();
if (navMeshSuccess) {
    console.log('Navigation mesh built successfully');
}
```

### 2. Person Movement
```javascript
// People automatically calculate paths using NavMesh
person.calculatePathToTarget(targetX, targetZ);

// Movement follows waypoints smoothly
person.updateSmoothMovementWithPath(deltaTime);
```

### 3. Pathfinding Example
```javascript
// Get NavMesh from house
const navMesh = house.getNavMeshPlanner();

// Find path from start to end
const start = new THREE.Vector3(person.worldX, 0, person.worldZ);
const end = new THREE.Vector3(furnitureWorldX, 0, furnitureWorldZ);
const path = navMesh.findPath(start, end);

// Path contains waypoints for smooth movement
if (path && path.length > 0) {
    person.currentPath = path;
}
```

## Key Features

### Automatic Navigation Mesh Building
- Analyzes house rooms and marks floors as walkable
- Identifies door positions for room connections
- Creates navigation nodes and connections
- Handles diagonal movement for natural paths

### Smart Pathfinding
- A* algorithm for optimal routes
- Avoids walls and obstacles automatically
- Routes through doors between rooms
- Provides smooth waypoint-based movement

### Debug Visualization
- Toggle NavMesh debug button in toolbar
- Shows navigation nodes (blue spheres)
- Shows door nodes (green spheres)
- Shows connections between nodes (gray lines)

## Usage in Your Simulation

### 1. Automatic Integration
The NavMeshPlanner is automatically integrated into your existing system:
- Loads with other components
- Built after house generation
- Used by all people for movement

### 2. Debug Features
- Press "Toggle NavMesh" button to see navigation mesh
- Console logs show NavMesh statistics
- Visual debugging shows walkable areas and connections

### 3. Performance
- Navigation mesh built once per house generation
- Pathfinding queries are fast and efficient
- Minimal impact on simulation performance

## Benefits Over Previous System

### Before (Direct Movement)
- People moved in straight lines
- Could get stuck on walls
- No awareness of room layout
- Simple but unrealistic movement

### After (NavMesh Pathfinding)
- People follow realistic paths around walls
- Automatically use doors to move between rooms
- Smooth, natural-looking movement
- Intelligent routing through house layout

## Technical Details

### Navigation Mesh Structure
- **Nodes**: Grid positions that are walkable
- **Connections**: Links between adjacent walkable nodes
- **Doors**: Special nodes that connect rooms
- **A* Algorithm**: Optimal pathfinding between any two points

### Integration Points
- **House**: Builds and stores NavMeshPlanner
- **Person**: Uses NavMesh for pathfinding
- **PersonManager**: Passes house reference to people
- **Renderer**: Can visualize NavMesh for debugging

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Dynamic Obstacles**: Update NavMesh when furniture moves
2. **Multiple Agents**: Optimize for many people pathfinding
3. **Behavioral Pathfinding**: Consider social preferences in routes
4. **Performance Optimization**: Spatial partitioning for large houses

### Advanced Features
1. **Height Awareness**: Multi-level house support
2. **Animation Integration**: Path-based animation blending
3. **Group Movement**: Coordinated group pathfinding
4. **Emergency Routing**: Fastest escape route calculation

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **No NavMesh Built**: Check console for build errors
2. **People Not Moving**: Verify NavMesh is available to people
3. **Performance Issues**: NavMesh debug visualization can be heavy
4. **Pathfinding Failures**: Check if start/end positions are walkable

### Debug Steps
1. Enable NavMesh debug visualization
2. Check console for NavMesh statistics
3. Verify house has doors and walkable areas
4. Test pathfinding with simple start/end positions

## Conclusion

The NavMeshPlanner provides a significant upgrade to your simulation's movement system. People now move realistically through your procedurally generated houses, using doors and following natural paths around walls. The integration is seamless and maintains compatibility with your existing codebase while adding sophisticated 3D-aware pathfinding capabilities.
